# ClientAdminGeneration


This script was created to be used with RMM in auto creating the username ClientAdmin and setting a password using a dictionary file. If you would like to add more words to the file, simply modify the english.txt.
The non encoded and econded versions are the same. I created the encoded version to obfuscate the entire script and only make the output readable.




Disclaimer:
There is absolutely zero security in this script and you should use it at your own risk.
