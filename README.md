# ClientAdminGeneration


This script was created to be used with RMM in auto creating the username ClientAdmin and setting a password using a dictionary file. If you would like to add more words to the file, simply modify the english.txt.
The non encoded and econded versions are the same. I created the encoded version to obfuscate the entire script and only make the output readable.

The script also calls on english.txt via github. If you would like to make the file more secure I would recommend keeping it private and adding more/different words to it. Passwords using this word bank should be around 125Bits of entropy.




Disclaimer:
There is absolutely zero security in this script and you should use it at your own risk.
